- I think i finally found the site i was looking for - https://drippop.com/
- I am also looking for other two design inspirations 
- some i recall are boomi.com for cards
- good for some elements including pricing cards https://leavemealone.com
- this has some interesting interaction of listview and changing images on desktop vs scrolling cards on mobile -> https://www.greenhouse.com
- https://whereispoland.com/en/m/ nice design inspiration
